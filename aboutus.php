        <h3>Who We Are</h3><br>
        




        <img src="image/as.png" alt="about us" height="200px" width="300px"><br><br>
        <p align="justify">We created the mobile communications industry. We invented most of the protocols and technologies that make mobile communications possible, including the first mobile phone, the first base station, and most everything in between.

Today, we are combining that pioneering spirit with a renewed commitment to consumers. That's why our phones run on Android, the world's most popular operating system. Android brings the openness that shaped the Internet to the mobile world. That's also why we are dedicated to bringing consumers around the world great value through devices that don't compromise on quality, experiences or style.

For the past 80 years, our engineers have thrived on invention and on finding new ways to solve problems. We continue to look for new opportunities to change people's lives for the better through the magic of mobility.</p>

        <h3>Evolution of Mobile Phone</h3><br>
        <h4>2011 – 2014</h4>
        <h4>Life Companion</h4>
        <p align="justify">Smartphones became increasingly central to modern life, offering much more than just communication features. The UK’s first 4G service launched in 11 cities by EE in 2012 taking download speeds up to 12mbps. Voice recognition became common place first with Google Voice before Apple launched Siri into the market. Samsung added a built-in heart rate monitor to their flagship Galaxy S5 to capitalise on growth in mobile health & fitness.</p><br>
        <h4>2015 - 2018</h4>
        <h4>Size Matters</h4>
        <p align="justify">The global adoption of 4G vastly improves video streaming and video calling capabilities. Screen sizes continue to grow to maximise the experience of these features, with the iPhone 7 Plus display now 57% larger than the original iPhone from 2007. Mobile payments also emerge with Apple Pay and Android Pay offering users the possibility of buying things with their smartphone.</p><br>
        <h4>2019 - 2020</h4>
        <h4>The Superfast World</h4>
        <p align="justify">EE launches the UK’s first 5G service in 6 cities throughout May 2019. The fifth-generation network promises vastly superior data speeds and reliability, boosting ultra-high-resolution video streaming and mobile gaming. Handset design trends continue to push for an all-screen experience, with OnePlus introducing the pop-up selfie camera to its flagship 7 Pro device to do away with the notch altogether.</p><br>
